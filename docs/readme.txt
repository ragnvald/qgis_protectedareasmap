Making protected areas maps with QGIS
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

QGIS project file and associated data sources will help you generate protected areas maps for different types of protected areas.

The system is based on the following sources of data:

* Your own relieff map
* Protected areas sample imagery, your own or from other sources
* OpenStreetmap data
* Protected areas data from the protectedplanet.net

Some processing is done using python scripts to create relevant information tables.

The QGIS project file contains relevant styling and composer maps. There are two map categories:

Main map (national scale) - selected protected area categories
Protected areas atlas - selected protected area categories
